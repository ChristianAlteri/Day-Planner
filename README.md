# Day-Planner
This web app allows you to plan your day by entering TODO's: into the text area. It will save your entry so you can re open the browser and your data will still be there! I used colors to mark if an hour has passed is coming or is present. The time is also displayed at the top.

## Function
Enter a TODO: to see how it works!
